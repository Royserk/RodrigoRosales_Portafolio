Portfolio for multiple Data Science projects using Python.

# [Project 1: Predicting who survived from the Titanic Shipwreck](https://github.com/Royserk/Titanic/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb)
Participating on the Machine Learning competition of Kaggle named ["Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster".](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
This is a project that predicts who survived from the Titanic Shipwreck occurred in April 15, 1912.

# [Project 2: Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis](https://github.com/Royserk/911_Calls/blob/main/Emergency%20911%20Calls.ipynb)
In this project, I used Python to do some data wrangling and I worked with different types of columns to create some powerful visualizations to see how the emergency calls varied in different time frames.
I used the dataset [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert) by Montgomery County, PA.
#### Project Planning
1. Import the libraries and Dataset
2. Explore the dataset
3. Data wrangling
4. Visualizations 


# [Project 3: Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis](https://github.com/Royserk/Netflix/blob/main/Netflix.ipynb)
This project is all about usign the basics of Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. I created some beautiful visualizations to see trends on the data.
I used the dataset [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) that was put together by Flixable.
#### Project Planning
