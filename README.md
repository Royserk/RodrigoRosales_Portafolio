# [Project 1: Predicting who survived from the Titanic Shipwreck](https://github.com/Royserk/Titanic/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb)
Participating on the Machine Learning competition of Kaggle named ["Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster".](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
This is a project that predicts who survived from the Titanic Shipwreck ocurred in April 15, 1912.

3. Basic Data Analysis with groups
4. Dealing with Outliers
5. Dealing with missing values
6. Discovering some trends
7. Feature Engineering
8. Dropping non useful features
9. Dummy variables
10. Value preparation for models
11. Scale Data
12. Model Building - using cross validation
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Clasifier
    - Desicion Tree
    - Random Forest
    - K Nearest Neighbor
